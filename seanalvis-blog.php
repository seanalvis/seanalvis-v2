		<p>I have just attended <a href="http://frontenddesignconference.com/">The Front-End Design Conference</a> and it was amazing. It has inspired me to get back to my roots and rebuild my personal site from the ground up.  I have never had a blog, and I can’t imagine anyone wanting to read it, but I hope it will help me grow as a Web Developer and as a person. So this is going to be a hybrid blog in the fact that it will be as much my poorly typed musings as it will be code repositories in and uploads in Git. This scares me in a way as I am going to confront all of my deficiencies as a “developer” live for everyone to see. My hope is that someone will be inspired in some way to realize they can do it. You see, I have a job as a Junior Web Developer. So if I can do it blah blah blah. </p>

		<p>Anyways, at Front-End I realized that I really need to go back to my roots and build something from the nitty gritty. I could start from absolutely nothing, but I want to pay homage to my Web Design teacher and mentor <a href="bravo-delapaz.com">Mr. Omar Bravo</a>. So I said I was taking this back to my roots, I am going to start with the framework that Omar built and donated to his students. I found a copy that I had began to rebuild as my own right after I graduated. I will start with this as my base and build something that I hope will become awesome. I will keep this repo public and update it and my personal site.</p>
